text: "Ever since creating a simple DAW as part of an assignment using MATLAB, I have been intrigued by them and sought out to understand and use them effectively. Working with sound and music throughout university in merely a programming context, I was keen to dive deeper into the medium and take up any new project to develop my skills further. <br/><br/>

I decided to learn the Guitar and have recently picked up a Synthesiser. I am now in a band called Kampango, playing the Guitar and Synth, which regularly play original music in venues around Cardiff. <br/><br/> 

Due to the current situation, studio recordings have been cut short unfortunately. However, the current demos on soundcloud have been produced and edited by myself.<br/><br/>

Taking on these projects has made me feel confident in my understanding of various synths and has opened up a new area for me to explore.<br/><br/>
