text: "Having played games my whole life, and now being competent in programming and music production; I have decided to create a 2D game using C# and Unity. <br/><br/> 

I have spent most of my weekends since lockdown writing various scripts to aid game development. As it stands, an A* pathplanning system and weapon pickups/switching have been developed (alongside general movement and shooting mechanics). I have recently begun development on a smart AI system using GOAP(Goal Oriented Action Planning) to give the game some variance and a different feel every time you play. <br/><br/> 

Being responsible for all parts of the games development has proved an interesting and satisfying exercise. Sound effects and foley in general is something I haven't explored before - and having limited resources at home when it comes to equipment has in fact made it very exciting. Having to find and morph samples, use household objects etc. to turn them into real usable sound effects has turned out to be very fun! <br/><br/>

I have also decided to start honing my skills in photo editing software to create the sprites and animation. "
