text: 'At Tendertec I had the opportunity to work with various in-house micro-controllers based off the Raspberry Pi and ESP32. My first task was redesigning the system to work simultaneously while still receiving data seamlessly, at a high frame rate. I made thorough use of the multiprocessing and threading modules in python and feel confident both working with both micro-controllers and asynchronous programming. This task also entailed heavy use of the sockets module and hand written server/client side code.<br/> <br/>
Due to the nature of the work, the resources available once in production were limited. This required close attention to resources being used via both network and hardware. This gave me experience refactoring code to both increase readabilty and use a minimal amount of resources.
<br/><br/> 
I had the pleasure of being part of the Machine Learning team, working directly with the lead developer on object detection and activity recognition systems. The opportunity to work closely with such an experienced developer has had an invaluable impact on the quality of code I produce now.
<br/> <br/> 
The technoligies used include, but are not limited to:
<br /> <br/ >
&middot; cv2 &middot; multiprocessing &middot; threading &middot; asyncio &middot; keras &middot; tensorflow &middot; sockets &middot; TCP/IP &middot; UDP &middot; pathlib &middot; numpy &middot; Jira &middot; Microsoft Teams'

<!-- At Tendertec I had the opportunity to work with various in-house micro-controllers based off the Raspberry Pi and ESP32. Within the first 2 weeks 
I was challenged to redesign the current system to work synchronously to allow for multiple signals to be received and uploaded simulatenously at a high frame rate. I made thorough use of Pythons multiprocessing and threading modules and feel very comfortable with them now. Solutions using asyncio were also explored giving me some background knowledge on the widely used module. <br/> <br/>Although technically not my position, some adjustments occasionally had to be made to micro-controller code, written in C. I still would not say I'm proficient in C, however when a problem arose I was able to use my general programming knowledge to find a solution. -->
