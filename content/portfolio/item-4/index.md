text: 'I was the Team Lead of Cardiff Racing Driverless 2019/20 and member during 2019 summer. Cardiff Racing Driverless was a division of the Cardiff Racing team that would compete in the international IMechE competition, FS-UK. The goal of the competition being to produce the best self driving formula car.<br/><br/> 

As team lead I had responsibility for growing the team, recruiting new members, liasing with sponsors, attending conferences, giving lectures and holding labs. Within the first month I had grown the number of members from 3 to 15-20 dedicated members with some working on the project on and off. I would also hold weekly lectures to introduce new members to techniques that may not be taught on the curriculum such as machine learning. Working on the project has given me excellent communication skills and stronger project management skills, especially in environments with varying skill levels.<br/><br/>

As a member I worked on a reinforcement learning environment that would be used to test the effectiveness of RL in real-time object avoidance. Using a physics based engine - we could simulate wheel turning and some basic LiDAR in the simulation to see if was worth pursuing that path. I also contributed to the cone detection system that would later be used in the final system.
