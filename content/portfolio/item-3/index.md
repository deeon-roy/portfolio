text: 'Deep Learning Guitar Tunings was the task I undertook for my dissertation, it entailed taking using a machine learning model to listen to songs and pick out the tuning that the guitar was in. At the time the task had not been accomplished before, meaning I had to formulate the solution myself - researching deeply into academic papers regarding musical analysis, harmonics, machine learning and signal processing techniques. <br/><br/> 

The preprocessing consisted of taking a large audio data set and slicing it into uniform sections applying transformations into the frequency domain accordingly. Many parameters were tested to find the optimal solution and required a system to be built that conducted multiple experiments and logged the data effectively.<br/><br/> 

A package compatible with pip was created during development for the all the necessary preprocessing tasks. Intended for use in future development concerning audio analysis.<br/><br/>
The problem was solved, proving that semantic data could be extrapolated from audio - even in noisy environments with many different instruments. <br/><br/> 


The technologies used include, but are not limited to: <br/><br/>
&middot; librosa &middot; keras &middot; tensorflow &middot; scikit-learn &middot; pandas &middot; os &middot; numpy &middot; scipy &middot; matplotlib &middot; pickle &middot; pip
